This was supposed to be a touch based car game for a 48 hour contest but I never really started. Instead I ended up prototyping a little aquarium app with a weird bokah nightlight thing.

I still like the idea but I never developed it into anything beyond the few hours I spent tinkering on it.

It was written for iphone 2.x with the corona platform (www.anscamobile.com). I was using an early beta edition that may not be completely compatible anymore. I haven't run the project since the date of the previous commit, so it may take some porting to run. It shouldn't be too bad.
